Sluggish is a plugin for the Pidgin IM client that *sluggishly* changes the
status from Away to Available when you use the keyboard/mouse. Much like how
the client changes your status from Available to Away only after you have been
away from the keyboard for several minutes, Sluggish delays changing the status
to Available until you have been back at your keyboard for several minutes.

Tested on Windows 10/7 with Pidgin 2.12.0 and Debian 8.3 with Pidgin 2.11.0.

**Installation**

Download the plugin for your platform and Pidgin version from the [Releases](https://github.com/GrimRevenant/pidgin-sluggish/releases) tab.

Windows users copy *sluggish.dll* to *%appdata%\\.purple\plugins*

Linux users copy *sluggish.so* to *~/.purple/plugins*

Restart the Pidgin IM client and enable the plugin from the Tools menu.
