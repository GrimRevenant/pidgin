Sluggish is a plugin for the Pidgin IM client that *sluggishly* changes the
status from Away to Available when you use the keyboard/mouse. Much like how
the client changes your status from Available to Away only after you have been
away from the keyboard for several minutes, Sluggish delays changing the status
to Available until you have been back at your keyboard for several minutes.

Tested on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10

**Installation**

Windows users can download and copy [sluggish.dll](https://raw.github.com/jamesboston/pidgin/master/sluggish.dll) to %appdata%\\.purple\plugins

Linux users can download and copy [sluggish.so](https://raw.github.com/jamesboston/pidgin/master/sluggish.so) to ~/.purple/plugins

Restart the Pidgin IM client after installing the plugin.
